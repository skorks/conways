Usage:
     conways  [input grid]
where [input grid] is something along the lines of:
[[0,0,0,0,0], [0,1,1,1,0], [0,0,0,0,0]]
where 0 = dead cells, 1 = live cells
this will represent a grid like:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0 
0 0 0 0 0

you must make sure that all live cells are fully enclosed by 
dead cells, i.e. all the edges of the grid should be made 
up of zeros (dead cells)
